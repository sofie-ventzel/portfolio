# Portfolio
A portfolio of my work

## Description
This is the first version of an online portfolio, representing the work I have done to learn ffront end web developement.
There will be links to different projects and a description of the creator.

I have chosen to use my staircase photos as placeholder images for the different projects, until such time as links to real projects are added. The staircases represent the learning journey, as it is always one step at a time.
